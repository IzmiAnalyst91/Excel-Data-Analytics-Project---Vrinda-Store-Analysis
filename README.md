Excel Data Analytics Project - Vrinda Store Analysis

This project demonstrates how I have used Microsoft Excel to analyze data from the data set and create a sales report for the company "Vrinda Stores" with goal of helping them get an overall understanding of their customers and how best to retain and improve current customer relationships and target potential customers.

Key Findings:
1.Women contributed 64 percent and men contributed 36 percent of the total annual sales.
2.Adults (30 and below) contributed the most to  sales (Ages 30 and below were categorized as"Adults" and Ages 50 and above were categorized as "Seniors" and the remaining population as "Teenagers" to help simplify the field "Age Group"
3.80% of the sales were via online stores Amazon (35%),Myntra (23%) and Flipkart (22%).
4.Maharashta,Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states with the highest sales

Suggestions I would give to Vrinda Stores:
1.Marketing campaigns would perform best if the target women in the age bracket of 30-49 years of age , located in Maharastha, Karnataka and Uttar Pradhesh.
2.I would also advise using coupons for customers who use Amazon,Myntra and Flipkart who also meet the criteria in my first suggestion.
